#MARSHALLZ BLOG

##About
Being that I never personally used the original version of this blog, I decided to write tasks that APIs such as the New York Times to select sentences at random from various recent articles. These sentences are then combined to create new, nonsensical blog posts which are authored by a fictious nine year old user. 

##More
Once a user creates an account they are granted access to tools that allow them to create new posts as well as edit or delete any of their published entries. I am revisting this project and rebuilding it with Node and Express, Backbone, and MongoDB. In addition, for anyone wanting to leave comments on these posts they can do so by signing in with their Facebook account.

##Original
Originally built this blog in Sinatra. User authentication implemented using bcrypt's hash algorithm and PostgreSQL to store encrypted passwords.
